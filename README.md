# DailyPaperClub
Welcome to the Agora Paper Club, a collaborative learning community dedicated to understanding multi-modality models and their applications. Our mission is to delve into the depths of mathematics and artificial intelligence, exploring topics such as multi-modality reasoning, generation, and swarm collective intelligence.

## Mission
-------

Our mission is to foster a deep understanding of multi-modality models and their applications. We believe that the future of AI lies in the intersection of various modalities and that understanding these intersections will lead to breakthroughs in AI applications. We aim to create a collaborative environment where learners can explore these topics in depth, share their insights, and contribute to the collective knowledge of the community.

## Topics
------

Our discussions revolve around a wide range of topics in mathematics and AI, including but not limited to:

-   Multi-modality Reasoning: Understanding how different modalities can be combined to improve reasoning capabilities of AI models.
-   Generation: Exploring how multi-modality models can generate new data and insights.
-   Swarm Collective Intelligence: Studying how collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems can be applied to AI.

## Organization
------------

We understand that there are many different interesting topics in the field of AI and mathematics, and sticking to a single one for an extended period can be challenging. Therefore, we plan to have sessions on long-running topics like Geometric Deep Learning interspersed with shorter ones.

While we'll generally try to stay close to AI and mathematics, some topics require a basic introduction, so we'll have some of those as well.

## Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions from all members of the community. If there are particular topics you'd like us to cover, feel free to let us know or create an issue on this repo, and we'll add them to the list. If you are knowledgeable in some topic, and/or are motivated to present one or more sessions on it, we'd love to have you. Just open an issue on this repo on the topic, or reply to the existing issue for that topic.

### Guidelines for Contributors

In order to prepare sessions on a topic, it's important to have some source material available online that attendees can read. A topic will be considered ready to be covered once it has reading material, people willing to present, and an idea of how many sessions it should take, at which point it will be scheduled.

## Suggested Topics
----------------

Here is a list of suggested topics that we are interested in exploring:

-   Representation Theory
-   Geometric Deep Learning
-   Random Matrix Theory
-   Partial Differential Equations (Theory + ML applications)
-   Scientific Machine Learning
-   Undergraduate Physics (Electromagnetism, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics)
-   Advanced Linear Algebra
-   Dynamical Systems
-   Topology
-   Measure Theory
-   Game Theory
-   Information Geometry

Join us in our mission to understand multi-modality models and their applications. Let's learn together and contribute to the future of AI!
